Connecting to the virtual machine
=================================
.. note:: 
  You need to start the virtual machine first!

.. _ssh_connect:

Connect to control the machine
------------------------------
To control the machine, you need to connect to the ssh service.

In Windows this is done with PuTTY.

- start PuTTY
- fill Host Name: ``localhost``
- fill Port: ``2222``
- click Open or press <Enter>

In the black wnidow that appears, type your credentials:

- login as: ``user``
- user@localhostâ€™s password: ``user``

In Mac OS X or Linux, this is done with ssh tool::

  ssh -p 2222 user@localhost

Connect to copy files
---------------------
In Windows, WinSCP is used to copy files to Linux machines. You use the same information
as for PuTTY to log in.

In Mac OS X or Linux, the most simple command to copy a file into 
a home directory of ``user`` on a running virtual machine is::

  scp -P 2222 myfile user@localhost:~

Conect to RStudio
-----------------
This is the easiest one, just click this link: `Open RStudio <http://localhost:8787>`_.
Login with the same credentials (user, user).

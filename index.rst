NGS Course Nove Hrady
=====================
This course aims to introduce the participants to UNIX - an interface that is one of the most convenient
options for working with big data. Special attention is put on working with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data.
Most of the NGS data formats were designed to be textual, and textual data is where UNIX excels in its versatility.
With just a combination of basic UNIX tools one can achieve results that would require finding specialized software
in other envirnonments, with just few commands.

Not knowing 'the right way' to do things can be intimidating for the beggining users, so an additional section
stressing the 'best practice' was added to the supplementary materials.
